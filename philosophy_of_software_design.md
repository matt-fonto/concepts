# The Philosophy of Software Design

- Software design is where developers will spend most of their time

## Industry vs. Academia

- Are they that different?
- Industry: markets, sales, product people
- Academia: freedom to explore

## Tactical Tornadoes vs. 10x Engineers

- Less code, higher functionality
- Tactical coding: short-term focus
  - With AI, tactical coding will become more pervasive
- Strategic coding: long-term focus

## AI and Coding

- Low-level code will be easier to produce and we, as devs, will spend more time on design aspects
- To what degree can AI replace the higher-level design tasks?
  - So far, it doesn't seem likely, even though we're not sure about the future
- Software design will become increasingly important

## Software Design

- Decomposition problem. You take a large, complicated system and divide it up into smaller units you can implement relatively independently
- What is the most important idea in computer science? => **Decomposition**
- How do we take large, complicated problems and break them down?
  - Implementation: going about the invidual pieces
