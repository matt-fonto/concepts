## Interview Checklist

### Problem-solving boosters

- Boosters: Brute force optimization
- Help: Hunt for properties
- Developers: Decrease the difficulty
- Crack: Cycle through the catalog
- Algorithms: Articulate your blockers

### Checklist

- Understand the problem
- Design the algorithm
- Explain the solution
- Get Buy-In
- Code the solution
- Verify the solution

1. Understand the problem

   - Read the statement (twice)
   - Work through examples out loud
   - Ask clarifying questions
     - Edge cases
     - Input/output format
     - Scale constraints

2. Design the algorithm

- Minimally sketch naive solutions
- Identify upper & lower bounds
- Look for triggers
- Employ boosters

3. Explain the solution

- Examples
- Indented English
- Name & justify

4. Get Buy-In

- The magic question

5. Code the solution

- Main logic
- Helper functions
- Stop if you get lost

6. Verify the solution

- Top-to-bottom pass
- Tricky expressions
- Run through with tiny input
- Check edge cases
- Verify analysis

  - Common mistakes
    - Testing the concept, not code
    - Not thinking as you go

### Study plan

#### Tier 1

Topics are frequently in interviews. Foundational for other topics

- Dynamic arrays
- String manipulation
- Two pointers
- Grid & Matrices
- Binary Search
- Sets & Maps
- Stacks & Queues
- Recursion
- Sorting
- Linked Lists
- Trees
- Graphs

#### Tier 2

Common and important, but less foundational

- Heaps
- Sliding windows
- Backtracking
- Topological sort
- Prefix sum
- Dynamic programming
- Greedy algorithms

#### Tier 3

Extra credit, for those who really want to go above and beyond

- Monotonic Stacks & Queues
- Union-Find
- Data structure Design
- Set & Map implementations
- Tries
- Graphs (advanced)
- Dynamic programming (advanced)
- Bit manipulation
- Math

### Boosters

If boundary & trigger thinking don't point you to the right approach, start with the brute force...

#### 1. Brute Force optimimization

- Preprocessing pattern
- Data structure pattern
- Skip unnecessary work

---

If you need a new approach...

#### 2. Hunt for properties

- DIY
- Case analysis
- Reverse engineer the output pattern
- Sketch a diagram
- Reframe the problem

---

If you can't find any approach...

#### 3. Decrease the difficulty

- Tackle an easier version
- Break down the problem

---

Solution might be in your blindspot...

### 4. Cycle through the catalog

- Think: Could `____` be useful?

---

If you're still stuck...

#### 5. Articulate your blocker

- Don't say "hint"
- Show your work
