# Design Patterns

- Proven solutions to recurring design problems
- Help build flexible, maintainable and reusable code

https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns

- General concepts for solving a particular problem
- Pattern: more high-level solution than an algorithm, which is the implementation

- Algorithm: cooking recipe -> clear steps to achieve a goal
- Pattern: blueprint -> you can see features and results, but open for implementation

### What does the pattern consist of?

- Intent: describes problem and solution
- Motivation: further explains problem and the solution the pattern makes possible
- Structure: shows each part of the pattern and how they relate
- Code example

## Creational: Object Creation

Instead of creating objects directly, these patterns give you more flexibility in how objects come into existence

- Singleton

- Builder
- Factory

## Structural: The Relation Between Objects

How objects relate to each other. Blueprints for building larger structures from individual pieces

- Building larger structures from individual pieces

- Facade
- Adapter

## Behavioral: Object Communication

How objects communicate and interact to distribute responsibility

- Strategy
- Observer
