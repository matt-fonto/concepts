# Dev Tools

- Logpoints: Instead of adding `console.log()` to the code, you can:

  - Source > JS file > select the line > select `add logpoint` > select the message + value and it'll appear in the log
  - They persist across page reloads
  - `conditional breakpoint`: the code only pauses if certain condition is true

- CMD + SHIFT + P: Open the menu elements of the browser. Quite handy.

- Rendering tab: There are several cool features here, such as:

  - Layer nborder: showing the borders of your layouts
  - Scrolling performance issues
  - Preview website with different themes
  - and many more

- CSS Overview: Allows you yo have a sum up of the CSS

  - Useful for debugging, checking the colors profiles, contrast issues
  - How many font-sizes, font-weight, line-height are being used. Great for identifying issues with consistency

- Full page screenshot: Select the body element and select `take screenshot`

- Copy console: Instead of selecting and then copying the whole console, right click and select `copy console`

- Snippets: You can save custom JS on the browser through the Snippets.

  > sources > snippets > `new snippet`

  - it's like creating your own Chrome extension

- To clean cache: with the DevTools open, select reload, then there will be an option to clean the cache
