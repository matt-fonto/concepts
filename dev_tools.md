# Dev Tools

- Logpoints: Instead of adding `console.log()` to the code, you can:

  - Source > JS file > select the line > select `add logpoint` > select the message + value and it'll appear in the log
  - They persist across page reloads
  - `conditional breakpoint`: the code only pauses if certain condition is true

- CMD + SHIFT + P: Open the menu elements of the browser. Quite handy.

- Rendering tab: There are several cool features here, such as:
  - Layer nborder: showing the borders of your layouts
  - Scrolling performance issues
  - Preview website with different themes
  - and many more
