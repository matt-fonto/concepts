- More relevant for senior and above positions, while coding (data structures and algorithms) will be for all the levels

## Books

- Take notes, go one step at a time, jump between pages and **take your time** to learn the concepts taught
- Information is much more dense

- [Understanding Distributed Systems](https://understandingdistributed.systems/?ref=blog.pragmaticengineer.com): Good to start over
- [Systems Design Interview](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08CMF2CQF?ref=blog.pragmaticengineer.com): Most focused for preparing for interviews
- [Desiging Data-Intensive Applications](https://dataintensive.net/?ref=blog.pragmaticengineer.com): Goes very deep. Good to master the vocabulary in this domain
- [Software Engineering at Google](https://abseil.io/resources/swe-book?ref=blog.pragmaticengineer.com): Good overview of engineering practices at Google on the day to day
