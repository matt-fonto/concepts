# Systems Design Interviews

https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/preparing-for-the-systems-design-and-coding-interviews/

- More relevant for senior and above positions, while coding (data structures and algorithms) will be for all the levels

- Tech interviews being "standard" across Big Tech makes preparing for these a high-leverage activity. Study once, interview many times

## Books

- Take notes, go one step at a time, jump between pages and **take your time** to learn the concepts taught
- Information is much more dense

- [Understanding Distributed Systems](https://understandingdistributed.systems/?ref=blog.pragmaticengineer.com): Good to start over
- [Systems Design Interview](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08CMF2CQF?ref=blog.pragmaticengineer.com): Most focused for preparing for interviews
- [Desiging Data-Intensive Applications](https://dataintensive.net/?ref=blog.pragmaticengineer.com): Goes very deep. Good to master the vocabulary in this domain
- [Software Engineering at Google](https://abseil.io/resources/swe-book?ref=blog.pragmaticengineer.com): Good overview of engineering practices at Google on the day to day

## Resources

- Take a look at the link at the start of this page

## Mock interviews

- Join a discord server and find mock interview buddies, then take turns doing the interviews

## Working Environment

- Great software companies struggle to find enough qualified candidates
- By learning enough theory on distributed systems, you'd be already in the top half of applications at these places
