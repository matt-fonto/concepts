### 0. Array

- Ordered list, indexed by number -> `arr[4]`
- Good for:
  - iteration by index `O(1)`
  - simple iteration
- Bad for:
  - Insertion/deletion `O(n)`

```js
const arr = [10, 20, 30];
arr.push(40); // O(1)
arr.unshift(4); // O(n) shifts everything
```

#### Operations

- Access by index: O(1)
- Search:
  - unsorted: O(n) -> we need to look to all the elements
  - sorted: O(log n) -> we remove half entries on each operation
    - if element is bigger than middle, cut all the left elements. Else, cut all the right elements
- Insert:
  - end: O(1) -> arr.push(element)
  - beginning: O(n) -> shifts all elements one position -> arr.unshift(element)
- Delete:
  - end: O(1)
  - beginning: O(n) -> all elements shift left -> arr.shift()

#### Pros and Cons

- Pros

  - Simplest non-primitive data structure
  - Direct access by index
  - Simple iteration
  - Append at end

- Cons
  - Insertion/deletion (non-end): costly `O(n)` because of shifting elements
  - Fixes size (in low level languages): resizing can be expensive
  - Maintaining order

> Arrays are good for fast indexed access and sequential iteration, but bad for dynamic updates (unless done at the end)
