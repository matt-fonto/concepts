- How is the dev landscape changing with AI?
- How do I stay relevant and valuable?
  - We need to be strategic about what we focus
    - This shift seems different (not only paradigms, frameworks, etc). It's something more fundamental
    - The change is going to be deeper, it will redifine the role of the developer

## Important skills

1. Evolving into Architect role

   - Architectural thinking
   - AI can't make deep architectural thinking
   - Code, business constraints, operational priorities, long-term technical strategy
   - As AI gets better in writing code, the value of coding skills alone will decrease
   - The ability of designing systems, making strategical technical decisions that align with business goals, will increase

2. Mastering DevOps and Cloud-Native Technologies

   - Implemeting the design system decisions effectively with modern DevOps practices and cloud native solutions
   - How do you bring the vision (architecture, business decisions, etc) to live?
     - DevOps: key to scalable, reliable systems
       - Creating entire system that enables continuous delivery of value to users
       - Containers, Kubernetes, Cloud Services, CI/CD
   - AI can spill out code, but it can't make architectural decisions, least of all implement them safely
